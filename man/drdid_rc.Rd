\usage{
drdid_rc(
  y,
  post,
  D,
  covariates,
  i.weights = NULL,
  boot = FALSE,
  boot.type = "weighted",
  nboot = NULL,
  inffunc = FALSE,
  trim.level = 0.995
)
}
\arguments{
\item{y}{An \eqn{n} x \eqn{1} vector of outcomes from the both pre and post-treatment periods.}

\item{post}{An \eqn{n} x \eqn{1} vector of Post-Treatment dummies (post = 1 if observation belongs to post-treatment period,
and post = 0 if observation belongs to pre-treatment period.)}

\item{D}{An \eqn{n} x \eqn{1} vector of Group indicators (=1 if observation is treated in the post-treatment, =0 otherwise).}

\item{covariates}{An \eqn{n} x \eqn{k} matrix of covariates to be used in the propensity score and regression estimation. Please add a vector of constants if you want to include an intercept in the models.
If covariates = NULL, this leads to an unconditional DiD estimator.}

\item{i.weights}{An \eqn{n} x \eqn{1} vector of weights to be used. If NULL, then every observation has the same weights. The weights are normalized and therefore enforced to have mean 1 across all observations.}

\item{boot}{Logical argument to whether bootstrap should be used for inference. Default is FALSE.}

\item{boot.type}{Type of bootstrap to be performed (not relevant if \code{boot = FALSE}). Options are "weighted" and "multiplier".
If \code{boot = TRUE}, default is "weighted".}

\item{nboot}{Number of bootstrap repetitions (not relevant if \code{boot = FALSE}). Default is 999.}

\item{inffunc}{Logical argument to whether influence function should be returned. Default is FALSE.}

\item{trim.level}{The level of trimming for the propensity score. Default is 0.995.}
}
\value{
A list containing the following components:
\item{ATT}{The DR DiD point estimate}
\item{se}{ The DR DiD standard error}
\item{uci}{Estimate of the upper bound of a 95\% CI for the ATT}
\item{lci}{Estimate of the lower bound of a 95\% CI for the ATT}
\item{boots}{All Bootstrap draws of the ATT, in case bootstrap was used to conduct inference. Default is NULL}
 \item{att.inf.func}{Estimate of the influence function. Default is NULL}
 \item{call.param}{The matched call.}
 \item{argu}{Some arguments used (explicitly or not) in the call (panel = TRUE, estMethod = "trad", boot, boot.type, nboot, type="dr")}
}
\description{
\code{drdid_rc} is used to compute the locally efficient doubly robust estimators for the ATT
 in difference-in-differences (DiD) setups with stationary repeated cross-sectional data.
}
\details{
The \code{drdid_rc} function implements the locally efficient doubly robust difference-in-differences (DiD)
estimator for the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT) defined in equation (3.4)
in Sant'Anna and Zhao (2020). This estimator makes use of a logistic propensity score model for the probability
of being in the treated group, and of (separate) linear regression models for the outcome of both treated and comparison units,
in both pre and post-treatment periods.


The propensity score parameters are estimated using maximum
likelihood, and the outcome regression coefficients are estimated using ordinary least squares;
see Sant'Anna and Zhao (2020) for details.

\examples{
# use the simulated data provided in the package
covX = as.matrix(cbind(1, sim_rc[,5:8]))
# Implement the 'traditional' locally efficient DR DiD estimator
drdid_rc(y = sim_rc$y, post = sim_rc$post, D = sim_rc$d,
         covariates= covX)

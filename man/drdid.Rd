\arguments{
\item{yname}{The name of the outcome variable.}

\item{tname}{The name of the column containing the time periods.}

\item{idname}{The name of the column containing the unit id name.}

\item{dname}{The name of the column containing the treatment group (=1 if observation is treated in the post-treatment, =0 otherwise)}

\item{xformla}{A formula for the covariates to include in the model. It should be of the form \code{~ X1 + X2}
(intercept should not be listed as it is always automatically included). Default is NULL which is equivalent to \code{xformla=~1}.}

\item{data}{The name of the data.frame that contains the data.}

\item{panel}{Whether or not the data is a panel dataset. The panel dataset should be provided in long format -- that
is, where each row corresponds to a unit observed at a particular point in time.  The default is TRUE.
When \code{panel = FALSE}, the data is treated
as stationary repeated cross sections.}

\item{estMethod}{the method to estimate the nuisance parameters.
The default is "imp" which uses weighted least squares to estimate the outcome regressions and
inverse probability tilting to the estimate the the propensity score, leading to the improved locally efficient  DR DiD estimator
proposed by Sant'Anna and Zhao (2020). The other alternative is "trad",
which then uses OLS to estimate outcome regressions and maximum likelihood to estimate propensity score. This leads
to the "traditional" locally efficient DR DiD estimator proposed by Sant'Anna and Zhao (2020).}

\item{weightsname}{The name of the column containing the sampling weights. If NULL, then every observation has the same weights. The weights are normalized and therefore enforced to have mean 1 across all observations.}

\item{boot}{Logical argument to whether bootstrap should be used for inference. Default is \code{FALSE} and analytical
standard errors are reported.}

\item{boot.type}{Type of bootstrap to be performed (not relevant if \code{boot = FALSE}). Options are "weighted" and "multiplier".
If \code{boot = TRUE}, default is "weighted".}

\item{nboot}{Number of bootstrap repetitions (not relevant if boot = \code{FALSE}). Default is 999.}

\item{inffunc}{Logical argument to whether influence function should be returned. Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{trim.level}{The level of trimming for the propensity score. Default is 0.995.}
}
\value{
A list containing the following components:
\item{ATT}{The DR DiD point estimate}
\item{se}{ The DR DiD standard error}
\item{uci}{Estimate of the upper bound of a 95\% CI for the ATT}
\item{lci}{Estimate of the lower bound of a 95\% CI for the ATT}
\item{boots}{All Bootstrap draws of the ATT, in case bootstrap was used to conduct inference. Default is NULL}
\item{att.inf.func}{Estimate of the influence function. Default is NULL}
 \item{ps.flag}{Convergence Flag for the propensity score estimation
 (only active if \code{estMethod = "imp"}.): =0 if \code{trust} algorithm converged,
   =1 if IPT (original) algorithm converged (in case it was used), =2 if
   GLM logit estimator was used (i.e., if both \code{trust} and IPT
   did not converged).}
\item{call.param}{The matched call.}
\item{argu}{Some arguments used in the call (panel, estMethod, boot, boot.type, nboot, type="dr")}
}
\description{
\code{drdid} is used to compute the locally efficient doubly robust estimators for the ATT
 in difference-in-differences (DiD) setups. It can be used with panel or stationary repeated cross section data.
 Data should be store in "long" format.
}
\details{
When panel data are available (\code{panel = TRUE}), the \code{drdid} function implements the
locally efficient doubly robust difference-in-differences (DiD) estimator for the average treatment effect
on the treated (ATT) defined in equation (3.1) in Sant'Anna and Zhao (2020). This estimator makes use of
a logistic propensity score model for the probability of being in the treated group,
and of a linear regression model for the outcome evolution among the comparison units.


When only stationary repeated cross-section data are available (\code{panel = FALSE}), the \code{drdid} function
implements the locally efficient doubly robust difference-in-differences (DiD) estimator for the
average treatment effect on the treated (ATT) defined in equation (3.4) in Sant'Anna and Zhao (2020).
This estimator makes use of a logistic propensity score model for the probability of being in the
treated group, and of (separate) linear regression models for the outcome of both treated and comparison units,
in both pre and post-treatment periods.


When one sets \code{estMethod = "imp"} (the default), the nuisance parameters (propensity score and
outcome regression parameters) are estimated using the methods described in Sections 3.1 and 3.2 of
Sant'Anna and Zhao (2020). In short, the propensity score parameters are estimated using the inverse
probability tilting estimator proposed by Graham, Pinto and Pinto (2012), and the outcome
regression coefficients are estimated using weighted least squares,where the weights depend on
the propensity score estimates; see Sant'Anna and Zhao (2020) for details.

When one sets \code{estMethod = "trad"}, the propensity score parameters are estimated using maximum
likelihood, and the outcome regression coefficients are estimated using ordinary least squares.

The main advantage of using \code{estMethod = "imp"} is that the resulting estimator is not only
locally efficient and doubly robust for the ATT, but it is also doubly robust for inference;
see Sant'Anna and Zhao (2020) for details.

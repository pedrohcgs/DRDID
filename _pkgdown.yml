  - title: "Locally efficient DR DID estimators"
    desc: >
      The following functions implement the locally efficient doubly robust
      difference-in-differences estimators propose by Sant'Anna and Zhao (2020).


      The resulting estimator remains consistent for the ATT even if either the
      propensity score or the outcome regression models are misspecified. If all working models are correctly specified, then
      the estimator achieves the semiparametric efficiency bound.

  - title: "DR DID estimators that are not locally efficient"
    desc: >
      When only repeated cross-section data are available, not all DR DID estimators are
      locally efficient, see Sant'Anna and Zhao (2020). The following functions implement
      these DR DID estimators that are not locally efficient, though, in practice, we recommend
      users to favor the estimators in the category above in detriment of these.

  - title: "IPW DID estimators"
    desc: >
      The following functions implement the inverse probability weighted (IPW)
      difference-in-differences estimators propose by Abadie (2005), with either
      normalized/stabilized weights (Hajek-type estimators) or with unnormalized weigts
      (Horvitz-Thompson-type estimators).


      The resulting IPW DID estimator is consistent
      for the ATT only if the propensity score is correctly specified.

  - title: "Outcome regression DID estimators"
    desc: >
      The following functions implement the outcome regression (OR) based
      difference-in-differences estimators for the ATT, see e.g. Heckman, Ichimura, and
      Todd (1997).


      The resulting OR DID estimator is consistent for the ATT only if the
      outcome regression model for the evolution of the outcomes for the comparison group
      is correctly specified.

  - title: "TWFE DID estimators"
    desc: >
      The following functions implement the two-way fixed-effects (TWFE)
      difference-in-differences estimators for the ATT.

      As illustrated by
      Sant'Anna and Zhao (2020) in their simulation exercise, this class of estimators
      in general do not recover the ATT in DID setups with covariates. As so, we
      encourage users to adopt alternative specifications.
